/**
 * Base class for a user-defined table function (UDTF) in AthenaX. A user-defined table functions works on
 * zero, one, or multiple scalar values as input and returns multiple rows as output.
 *
 * <p>The behavior of a [[AthenaXTableFunction]] can be defined by implementing a custom evaluation
 * method. An evaluation method must be declared publicly, not static and named "eval".
 * Evaluation methods can also be overloaded by implementing multiple methods named "eval".</p>
 *
 * <p>User-defined functions must have a default constructor and must be instantiable during runtime.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   public class Split extends TableFunction&lt;String&gt; {
 *
 *     // implement an "eval" method with as many parameters as you want
 *     public void eval(String str) {
 *       for (String s : str.split(" ")) {
 *         collect(s);   // use collect(...) to emit an output row
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *     // you can overload the eval method here ...
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @tparam T The type of the output row
